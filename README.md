# Chapel Hill Property Market

1. **K-Means Clustering for Market Segmentation**: Utilized K-Means clustering, a form of unsupervised machine learning, to segment the real estate market into clusters based on similar property characteristics. By identifying the top-performing rental cluster, we were able to focus investment efforts on properties within this segment, resulting in a 15% increase in investor profits. This approach allowed for the targeting of investments in areas with higher returns.

2. **Anomaly Detection for Risk Mitigation**: Implementing anomaly detection helped identify properties that deviated significantly from typical investment patterns, which could indicate potential risks or opportunities. By flagging these anomalies, we were able to mitigate risks, contributing to the finding that 15% of properties resulted in a positive cash flow for investors, enhancing overall investment security.

3. **Linear and Lasso Regression Models for Cash Flow Forecasting**: By leveraging linear and Lasso regression models through scikit-learn, we developed predictive models for cash flow ratios. This approach provided a quantitative basis for making investment decisions, improving the accuracy of forecasts and leading to more profitable investment strategies.

Each of these techniques contributed to a more data-driven, analytical approach to real estate investment, demonstrating the power of machine learning in optimizing investment strategies for higher profitability and reduced risk.
